        <h2>Portfolio Project</h2>
        <p>This website is my portfolio project for <strong>CS290</strong> at <strong>Oregon State University</strong></p>
        <p>I have used many technologies to put this together, including:</p>
        <p><strong>HTML</strong>: The HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of all web pages. It is used to define the structure and content of a web page.</p>
        <p><strong>CSS</strong>: Cascading Style Sheets is used to control the appearance of a web page. It can be used to change the font, color, size, and layout of text and images.</p>
        <p><strong>Express</strong>: Express is a web application framework written in Node.js. It provides a set of tools and libraries that make it easy to develop web applications.</p>
        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong>: JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity to web pages. It can be used to create animations, games, and other dynamic content.</p>
        <p><strong>MongoDB</strong>: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is used to store data in a flexible and scalable way. It is a good choice for storing data for web applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Mongoose</strong>: Mongoose is a MongoDB object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it easy to work with MongoDB data from JavaScript.</p>
        <p><strong>Node</strong>: Node is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side. It is a good choice for developing web applications that require high performance or real-time data processing.</p>
        <p><strong>React</strong>: React is a JavaScript library that is used to create user interfaces. It is a popular choice for developing web applications because it is fast, scalable, and easy to use.</p>
        <p><strong>REST</strong>: REST is a set of architectural principles for developing web services. It is a good choice for developing web applications that need to be interoperable with other systems.</p>
        <p>Because I have used the above technologies for this website, I have a site that is fast and scalable. The design choices make it easy to navigate, all while meeting accessibility standards. I hope you enjoy my awesome site!</p>
